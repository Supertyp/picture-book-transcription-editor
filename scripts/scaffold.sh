# scaffold.sh — copy the Bower framework footprint into a target directory.
#
# Usage: scripts/scaffold.sh <target-dir>
#
# Always copies (overwrites):
#   - _bower/                 (excluding project-CLAUDE.md, project-settings.json,
#                              VERSION, and SOURCE — VERSION is owned by /b-upgrade
#                              in the project; SOURCE is preserved so forks/mirrors
#                              are respected; the two templates are seeded out, not
#                              copied in.)
#   - .claude/agents/         (Bower subagents)
#   - .claude/commands/       (Bower /b-* slash commands)
#
# Conditionally creates:
#   - <target>/CLAUDE.md             only if the target has no CLAUDE.md, seeded
#                                    from _bower/project-CLAUDE.md.
#   - <target>/.claude/settings.json only if absent, seeded from
#                                    _bower/project-settings.json. Pre-allows
#                                    safe read-only Bash patterns Bower skills
#                                    use (find, ls, git status/diff/log/show,
#                                    rg, grep, wc) to cut permission-prompt
#                                    friction. The project owns this file
#                                    afterwards; edit freely.
#   - <target>/_bower/VERSION        only if absent. Holds the framework version
#                                    this project was last migrated to.
#                                    /b-upgrade in the project bumps this
#                                    step-by-step as migrations apply.
#   - <target>/_bower/SOURCE         only if absent. Holds the git URL of the
#                                    framework repo to clone from when
#                                    /b-upgrade runs. Written from this repo's
#                                    `origin` remote.
#
# Does not touch:
#   - target's existing CLAUDE.md, .claude/settings.json, _bower/VERSION, _bower/SOURCE
#   - target's docs/, .claude/settings.local.json, or anything else.
#
# Idempotent: re-running upgrades an existing project to the current framework
# version by refreshing _bower/ and .claude/agents,commands in place. The project
# should then run /b-upgrade to apply any per-version migrations and bump VERSION.
