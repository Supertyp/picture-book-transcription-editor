# Bower Framework — Contributor Instructions

**You are working on the Bower framework itself, not on a project built with Bower.** This repo is the source of the framework: the project-facing guidance, the skills (`/b-*` slash commands), the analyst subagent, and the supporting `_bower/` reference files. Projects consume this material by running the scaffold script; they do not edit it.

## What this means in practice

- **Do not invoke `/b-*` skills on this repo.** `/b-design`, `/b-feature`, `/b-module`, `/b-integration`, `/b-adr`, `/b-recap`, `/b-analysis`, `/b-index`, `/b-spec` are all designed for *Bower projects*. This repo has no `docs/modules/`, no `docs/architecture.md`, no `docs/scope.md` — running them here is meaningless. Edit framework files directly instead.
- **Every framework change gets a `_bower/changes.md` entry.** Prepend a new versioned section (most recent first) describing what changed, why, and any migration notes for projects already on a previous version. Bump the version in **both** `_bower/VERSION` (the canonical source, read by tooling) **and** `_bower/framework.md`'s top heading (a human-visible label) at the same time.
- **The project-facing CLAUDE.md is a template, not the live one.** This file (the root `CLAUDE.md`) is contributor-only. The template that projects receive lives at `_bower/project-CLAUDE.md`; it `@`-includes `_bower/framework.md`. When you change framework guidance, edit `_bower/framework.md` — projects pick up the change by re-running the scaffold script over their `_bower/` directory.

## Migration-notes authoring discipline

Every framework change gets migration notes in its `_bower/changes.md` entry. These notes are read by the `/b-upgrade` skill running in a downstream project — a model audience walking through one version at a time. Authoring discipline matters because a vague or context-dependent note will produce inconsistent upgrades across projects, and the failure may not surface until much later.

Write notes under a `### Migration` subheading inside the version's section. Rules:

- **Self-contained.** Do not write "see also v0.10's note" or "as in the previous version." `/b-upgrade` reads one version's section at a time; a cross-reference is a dangling pointer.
- **Written for a model audience.** Be explicit about which files to read, what to look for, and what to write. "Update `architecture.md`" is too vague. "For each module under `docs/modules/`, read its `module-status.md` and any `plan.md` to understand its purpose; add a `## Software architecture` section to `docs/architecture.md` with one entry per module covering purpose, data-concern boundary, constituent features, and inter-module dependencies" is the shape.
- **Name "no migration needed" explicitly.** If a version has no project-side migration work, write `### Migration` with a single line: `None — no project-side changes required.` Silence is ambiguous; "none" is decisive.
- **Distinguish mechanical from judgement-required work.** If a step is a direct file edit, say so. If it requires the model to read project content and synthesise (e.g. backfilling a section with content inferred from existing files), say *that* — the operator's self-assessment in `/b-upgrade` depends on knowing where discretion was exercised.
- **List file references inline.** Migration notes that say "read the schema in `_bower/brief-schema.md`" are fine — that file is now in the project after scaffold. Migration notes that reference files only in the framework repo (not scaffolded) need to inline the content.
- **Discuss with the user when uncertain.** If a change has subtle migration implications you're not sure about, ask the user before settling on the notes. A bad migration note compounds across every project that runs `/b-upgrade` after this version.

The historical entries (v0.8 through v0.12) use `**Migration notes**` bold paragraphs rather than `### Migration` subheadings; the skill is forgiving about that. Going forward, use the subheading form.

## Framework reference (read these before changing framework behaviour)

- `_bower/rationale.md` — **Why Bower works the way it does.** Design principles, comparisons to alternatives, and the reasoning behind structural choices. Consult before changing framework behaviour so the change stays coherent with the design.
- `_bower/changes.md` — **Versioned log of framework changes.** Most recent first. Append a new entry for every framework change in the same commit.
- `_bower/roadmap.md` — **Deferred improvements and their revisit triggers.** Check before proposing new framework work (it may already be deferred with a stated reason); update when deferring something new.
- `_bower/brief-schema.md` — **Schema the `bower-analyst` subagent emits** and `/b-design` Stage 0 consumes. Touch alongside any change to the analyst, the brief format, or Stage 0.
- `_bower/framework.md` — **The project-facing guidance** that gets `@`-included into a Bower project's CLAUDE.md. Edit this when changing how Bower projects are *used*, as opposed to how the framework itself is *built*.
- `_bower/VERSION` — **The canonical framework version.** Single line, the version string only (no `v` prefix). Read by the scaffold script and by `/b-upgrade` in projects. Bump this in the same commit as a `_bower/changes.md` entry; the heading in `_bower/framework.md` is a derived label that should match but is not read by tooling.

## Scaffolding a project from this repo

`scripts/scaffold.sh <target-dir>` (or `scripts\scaffold.ps1 <target-dir>` on Windows) copies `_bower/` and the `.claude/` agents and commands into the target. If the target has no `CLAUDE.md`, the script seeds one from `_bower/project-CLAUDE.md`. If it already has one, the script leaves it alone — the assumption is that the project's CLAUDE.md already `@`-includes `_bower/framework.md`, so re-copying `_bower/` is sufficient to upgrade the project to the current framework version. Similarly, if the target has no `.claude/settings.json`, the script seeds one from `_bower/project-settings.json` with safe read-only Bash permission defaults; if it already has one, the script leaves it alone.

The script never touches the target's `docs/`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, or anything outside the framework footprint.
