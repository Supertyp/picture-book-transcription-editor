# Bower Upgrade

You are running the Bower framework upgrade workflow in a **project** (not in the framework repo itself). This command:

1. Clones the Bower framework repo into a temp directory.
2. Runs its `scripts/scaffold.sh` (or `scaffold.ps1`) against this project to refresh `_bower/` and `.claude/`.
3. Walks each intermediate version's migration notes in order, applying them step-by-step and bumping `_bower/VERSION` after each.

Artifacts jump to the latest framework version in one scaffold pass; only `VERSION` moves step-by-step as migrations apply. This is intentional — see `_bower/changes.md` for the per-version migration notes that drive each step.

The user's optional argument: $ARGUMENTS

## Important Behavioural Rules

- **Refuse to run on a dirty working tree.** If `git status --porcelain` returns anything, abort and tell the user to commit or stash first. The whole upgrade is recoverable via `git reset --hard` only if there's a clean baseline to return to.
- **Walk versions sequentially.** Apply migration N's notes, finish it (bump VERSION, optionally commit), then start migration N+1. Never read multiple versions' notes into a single plan — each step's plan is derived from exactly one version's section in `_bower/changes.md`.
- **Migration notes can be empty or "none".** Many versions have no migration work. Acknowledge and proceed.
- **Self-assess at the end.** This data isn't structured, so we don't have a deterministic validator. After all steps, write a candid paragraph on how confident you are that each migration landed correctly — what was clean, what required judgement, what the user should eyeball. The user decides whether to `git reset --hard` based on your assessment.
- **You are running in the project, not the framework repo.** Do not edit the cloned framework. Edit project files only.

## Step 1: Preconditions

1. Run `git status --porcelain`. If the output is non-empty, stop. Tell the user the upgrade requires a clean working tree (so `git reset --hard` remains a valid escape) and recommend `git stash` or a commit. Do not proceed.
2. Read `_bower/VERSION` from the project. If the file is missing, the project predates the VERSION convention — use AskUserQuestion to ask the user what version their project is currently on (offer the versions listed in `_bower/changes.md` once you've read it in Step 3). Stop and wait for their answer before proceeding.
3. Read `_bower/SOURCE` from the project for the framework repo URL. If missing, use AskUserQuestion to ask the user for the framework repo URL (default suggestion: `https://github.com/ANU-HDRH/bower-framework.git`).

## Step 2: Clone the framework

Clone shallow into a unique temp directory:

```
git clone --depth 1 <SOURCE_URL> /tmp/bower-upgrade-$$
```

(Use `mktemp -d` or a timestamped path if `$$` isn't available — the path just needs to be unique and writable.) Remember the path; you'll need to clean it up at the end.

If the clone fails (network, auth, bad URL), surface the error to the user and stop.

## Step 3: Determine the upgrade plan

1. Read `<clone>/_bower/VERSION` — this is the new version.
2. Read `<clone>/_bower/changes.md` — this is the source of truth for migration notes.
3. Compare:
   - If `new == old`: tell the user "Already at v<old>" and stop. Clean up the temp dir.
   - If `new < old` (project is newer than framework remote — possible if the user is on a fork or a dev branch): stop with a confused message; do not proceed.
   - If `new > old`: continue.
4. Parse `changes.md` for the ordered list of `## vX.Y` headings strictly above `old` and up to and including `new`. This is the list of migration steps. E.g. project at v0.10, framework at v0.13 → steps = [0.11, 0.12, 0.13].

## Step 4: Decide commit cadence (only if multi-step)

If the step list contains more than one version, use AskUserQuestion to ask:

> The upgrade spans N version steps (v0.X → v0.Y → ...). Commit between each step, or do all steps and commit at the end?

Options:
- **Commit between each step** — Each version's changes land as a discrete commit (`bower: migrate vX.Y → vX.Z`). Easier to bisect, easier to partially `git reset` if one step misbehaves.
- **Commit at the end** — One commit covers the whole upgrade. Simpler history.

If the list is a single step, skip this question — the user can commit when they're satisfied.

## Step 5: Run the scaffold script

Run the scaffold from the clone against the project's working directory:

```
bash <clone>/scripts/scaffold.sh <project-root>
```

(On Windows, run `scaffold.ps1` instead.)

This refreshes `_bower/` (except `VERSION` and `SOURCE`, which the scaffold preserves) and `.claude/agents`/`.claude/commands`. The project's `_bower/VERSION` is still at the *old* value at this point — that's intentional. You own VERSION writes from here on.

**Note:** The scaffold just rewrote `.claude/commands/b-upgrade.md` (this skill). The new version takes effect on the next `/b-upgrade` invocation; this run continues with the instructions already in your context.

## Step 6: Walk migration steps

For each version in the step list, in order, oldest first:

### 6a. Extract migration notes for this version

Open the project's now-updated `_bower/changes.md`. Find the `## v<X.Y>` heading. Read everything under it up to the next `## v` heading. This is the version's full entry — what changed, why, and the migration notes.

Identify the migration content within that entry. Contributors write it under a `### Migration` subheading or a `**Migration notes**` bold paragraph (older entries). If the section is absent, "none", or describes no project-side work, treat the step as a no-op — just bump VERSION (and optionally commit) and continue.

### 6b. Plan

Read any project files the migration notes reference (e.g. `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/modules/*/module-status.md`). Produce a concrete plan:

- Exact files you'll edit or create.
- For each file, the specific change in plain language (not a diff — the user is reading this to decide, not to review syntax).
- Any judgement calls you're making (the notes were written for a model audience but still leave room for interpretation — name those calls).

### 6c. Gate

Present the plan via AskUserQuestion. Frame as: "Here's the plan for migration v<X.Y>. Confirm to apply, or tell me what to adjust."

Options:
- **Apply this plan** — proceed to execution.
- **Adjust** — user gives free-text feedback; revise and re-gate.
- **Skip this step** — apply no changes for this version but still bump VERSION (use sparingly; the user is overriding the migration notes).
- **Abort upgrade** — stop now. Tell the user the temp clone path so they can clean it up, and remind them `git reset --hard` reverses any committed steps.

### 6d. Execute

Apply the edits. Edit project files directly. Do not edit the cloned framework.

### 6e. Bump VERSION

Overwrite `_bower/VERSION` with this version's number (just the number, no `v` prefix, with a trailing newline to match the framework's format).

### 6f. Optional commit

If the user chose "commit between each step" in Step 4, commit now:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "bower: migrate v<old> → v<new>"
```

(Use the actual old/new strings.) If the user chose "commit at the end" or this is a single-step upgrade, do not commit yet.

## Step 7: Final summary and self-assessment

After all steps complete:

1. **Clean up** the temp clone directory (`rm -rf <clone>`).
2. **Emit a self-assessment.** Be candid. For each step:
   - What you applied.
   - What was mechanical vs. what required judgement.
   - Anything the user should sanity-check by eye (a file you weren't sure about, a backfill where the source data was thin, a decision the notes left to your discretion).
3. **Emit the handoff block** with the literal commands for what to do next:

```
Bower upgrade complete: v<old> → v<new>

Self-assessment:
  <candid paragraph per step or overall>

Next move:
  - If everything looks right: commit (if you chose end-of-run commits) and continue your work.
  - If something looks wrong: `git reset --hard <baseline-ref>` to undo, then investigate.
```

## What NOT To Do

- Do not run if `git status --porcelain` is non-empty
- Do not read more than one version's migration notes into a single plan — walk them strictly in order
- Do not edit files in the cloned framework repo — it is read-only reference; edit the project only
- Do not auto-commit if the user chose "commit at the end" or didn't see Step 4's question
- Do not silently skip a step whose migration notes are non-trivial — if you can't interpret them, ask via AskUserQuestion rather than guessing
- Do not bump VERSION before applying the step's migrations — the bump signals the migration landed
- Do not leave the temp clone directory behind
- Do not claim a clean migration if any part required substantial judgement — the self-assessment is for the user to decide whether to `git reset`, and an over-confident assessment defeats the safety mechanism
- Do not emit free-prose next moves — use literal shell/slash commands in the handoff
